/**
 * Running this class with jUnit will execute all *.feature files in the same package of your resources folder.
 *
 * Features for Cucumber are written in the "Gherkin" language.
 * See e.g. http://cukes.info/step-definitions.html to learn how
 * to write those features and the according step-definitions.
 *
 * Step 1: write a valid feature file and throw it into your
 *         resources folder, same package.
 * Step 2: run this class. The tests will fail but you'll see useful code-snippets in the output.
 * Step 3: add some implementation so that the tests do what you want
